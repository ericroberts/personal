title:  Anyone Can Make it Work Right Now
---

One of my favourite parts from Sandi Metz's book [Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby](http://www.poodr.com/)</cite>. Getting it to work is the boring part.

> Anyone can arrange code to make it work right now. Today's application can be beat into submission by sheer force of will. It's a standing target at a known range. It is at your mercy.

> Creating an easy-to-change application, however, is a different matter. Your applicaiton needs to work right now just once; it must be easy to change forever. This quality of easy changeability reveals the craft of programming. Achieving it takes knowledge, skill, and a bit of artistic creativity.
