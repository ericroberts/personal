A little over a year ago, I was happy. I had a decent job, I had a good group
of friends, and I had hobbies and interests outside of work. I did, however,
work from home, and it was boring. Sure, I talked to people via IM or phone
conversations throughout the course of the day, but it wasn’t the same as real
human interaction. I didn’t want to become the stereotypical developer who
stays holed up in his basement writing code, so I decided to see what I could
do about this problem. It just so happened that I stumbled upon an article
about coworking and a subsequent search for “coworking in Guelph” brought me to
ThreeFortyNine. I sent an email, came in to try it out for a day and ended up
with a desk in the building. Now I do all my work in an environment where I
have other people to talk to, bounce ideas off of, and fulfill my daily quota
of human interaction. My life got a little better, end of story.

Except… that’s not quite what happened. I thought I was paying for a desk, but
that’s not what I got. Instead, ThreeFortyNine ruined my life. You see, the
people there have this funny preoccupation with startups.

Creating a startup, for those of you who don’t know, is the process of finding
problems that don’t exist and charging people to fix them. Or at least that’s
what I used to think. Eric Ries, author of _The Lean Startup_, puts it a little
differently. According to him, startups are "_a human institution designed to
create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty_". It’s
that uncertainty part that gets me. Why would I want to leave my comfortable
job and attempt making something out of nothing in “conditions of extreme
uncertainty”?

Slowly however, my feelings towards startups began to change. I started
checking out ThreeFortyNine events like Founder’s Club and DemoCampGuelph. What
I found was a bunch of people who were passionate about what they do and why
they’re doing it. Looking at my own job, I couldn’t say that’s how I felt about
it. Did I like my job? Sure, it was acceptable. But after seeing these people
who were involved with their own projects, acceptable wasn’t good enough
anymore. Pursuing my own ideas started to seem more appealing than showing up
and being told what to do. So I got involved with a startup.

I didn’t initially jump at the offer to join a startup. I actually said no. I
felt I didn’t have the time to commit to my regular day job and something
extra. At the same time, I was starting to feel like I wanted to do something
that wasn’t my normal routine of building a site for a client, passing it off,
and moving to the next project. After some convincing, I reluctantly joined
Printchomp. In a few short months, my technical ability and business knowledge
has easily doubled. I work with a great team of people who are personally
invested in the results of our project. That sense of ownership makes the work
different. I’m not just passing it off to clients who are then going to use my
work to make money for themselves. What I do has a direct effect on my future.
It’s both exciting and terrifying at the same time.

As I got more involved with the startup world, I started to see things
differently. I don’t think that these companies are finding problems that don’t
exist and working to fix them. A lot of them are looking for the inefficiencies
in our everyday lives and looking to solve them. That’s what I identify with. I
like solving problems. Now I want to solve problems and get paid for it. And if
I got rich while doing that, I wouldn’t complain. That’s not too much to ask,
is it?

Before I came to ThreeFortyNine, everything was fine. I was perfectly happy
with my job, as long as I had enough money left over at the end of the week for
wings and beers with friends. The people I’ve met since then have made me
unhappy with my normal day-to-day job. They make me want to do something I’m
passionate about. They’ve ruined me.
