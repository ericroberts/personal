title: O Captain! My Captain!
---

> O Captain! My Captain! our fearful trip is done;<br>
> The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won;<br>
> The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,<br>
> While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring:
> &nbsp;&nbsp;But O heart! heart! heart!<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O the bleeding drops of red,<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where on the deck my Captain lies,<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fallen cold and dead.

> O Captain! My Captain! rise up and hear the bells;<br>
> Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills;<br>
> For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding;<br>
> For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
> &nbsp;&nbsp;Here captain! dear father!<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This arm beneath your head;<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is some dream that on the deck,<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You've fallen cold and dead.

> My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still;<br>
> My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will;<br>
> The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done;<br>
> From fearful trip, the victor ship, comes in with object won;
> &nbsp;&nbsp;Exult, O shores, and ring, O bells!<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I, with mournful tread,<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walk the deck my captain lies,<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fallen cold and dead.
